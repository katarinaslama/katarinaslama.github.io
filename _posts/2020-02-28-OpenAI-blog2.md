# OpenAI Scholars: Second Steps

My [First Steps](https://katarinaslama.github.io/2020/02/24/OpenAI-blog1/) post concluded with a wish to "run into more problems in the space of coding and implementing neural network architectures". I did succeed in running into problems... ...on my way to getting started with coding and implemented neural network architectures.

I wanted to "simply" feed some other data into the convolutional neural network from [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py). In order to do so, I had to get that data onto my [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) Virtual Machine (VM). The data I wanted to try was too large for my existing VM, so I needed to add additional disk storage. This proved to be easier said than done. After a number of more courageous than competent `sudo` commands, I had succeeded in breaking my VM. By "pizza hour" (4 pm on Tuesday), I was truly starting to despair of the situation. Fortunately, my fellow scholar [Alethea](https://aletheap.github.io/), who has much more experience than I do in software engineering and systems administration, came to my rescue. In lieu of a longer blog post about my learning this week, [here is a writeup](https://katarinaslama.github.io/2020/02/26/mounting-extra-storage-on-your-VM/) of how to mount extra storage onto your Azure VM, should you ever run into the same conundrum as I did.
