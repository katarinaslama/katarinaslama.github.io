<!-- ## This is a title -->



I am currently studying deep learning as a member of the [OpenAI Scholars Program](https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-spring-2020/)
This is the home of my blog.

I have a PhD in [Neuroscience from UC Berkeley](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/ph-d-program/),
where I studied attention using [intra-cranial recordings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0108-2)
in humans.

<!-- Between college and graduate school, I worked as a laboratory manager
  in the <a href="https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/research">Nock Lab</a>
  at Harvard, studying suicide and self-injury. I have an ScB in Psychology
  from Brown University: As an undergraduate, I worked on research
  projects with <a href="https://www.lnccbrown.com/" >Michael Frank</a>
  (deep brain stimulation and moral decision-making) and <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/champions-of-psychology-cynthia-garcia-coll" >Cynthia Garcia Coll</a>
  (child development and immigration).
  </p>

<p> Before I got all focused on progressively smaller building blocks of cognition,
  I took a more global perspective: For my gap year before college, I worked in
  <a href="http://www.theborderconsortium.org/where-we-work/camps-in-thailand/mae-la-oon/" >this refugee camp</a>,
  having spent my late teens at  <a href="https://www.atlanticcollege.org/" >this magical school</a>.
